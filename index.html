      <p>We comply with applicable laws and regulations, including Law No. 27 of 2022 on Personal Data Protection (PDP Law) and Apple’s platform guidelines.</p>

    <h2>1. Application Overview</h2>
    <p>BiPro is a cloud-based HR application designed to support employee needs, including attendance (with facial recognition), leave/permission requests, reimbursement claims, status notifications, performance monitoring, and scheduling.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>

      <li><strong>Biometric Data (Face)</strong>: facial images and/or representations (embeddings/templates) for attendance verification. <em>By default</em>, verification is processed on-device; template storage on the server only applies if enabled by your company.</li>
      <li><strong>Attendance & Location Data</strong>: clock-in/clock-out times, IP address, approximate or precise location <em>(optional depending on company settings)</em> for attendance validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Request Data</strong>: leave/permission requests and history; reasons, attachments if any.</li>
      <li><strong>Reimbursement Data</strong>: claim details, amount, supporting documents (receipt photos/files).</li>

      <li><strong>Photos/Media & Camera</strong>: camera/gallery access when capturing/uploading photos for face verification or attaching documents.</li>
