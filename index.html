    <div class="meta">
      For: <strong>BiPro</strong><br/>
      Data Controller: <strong>Treffix</strong><br/>
      Effective Date: <strong>August 22, 2025</strong>

    <div class="card">
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and/or share your information when you use the <strong>BiPro</strong> application ("Application"). By using the Application, you agree to these privacy practices.</p>
      <p>We comply with applicable laws and regulations, including Law No. 27 of 2022 on Personal Data Protection (PDP Law) and Apple platform guidelines.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Application Overview</h2>
    <p>BiPro is a cloud-based HR application designed to support employee needs, including attendance (with face photo verification), leave/permission requests, reimbursement claims, status notifications, performance monitoring, and scheduling. The app also supports QR code scanning for certain actions configured by your company.</p>

    <h2>2) Data We Process</h2>
    <p>The categories of data we may process depend on the features you use and your company’s configuration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identity & Account Data</strong>: name, email, phone number, employee ID, division, position.</li>
      <li><strong>Face Data (Photos)</strong>: a photo of your face captured at check-in/check-out to verify attendance. <em>We do not sell or use face photos for marketing or advertising.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Optional Biometric Representation</strong>: if enabled by your company, a mathematical representation (embedding/template) derived from your face photo for automated matching. Otherwise, only the photo is stored with your attendance record.</li>
      <li><strong>Attendance & Location Data</strong>: clock-in/clock-out time, device time zone, and location (precise/approximate) for geofence validation in accordance with your company policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Request Data</strong>: leave/permission requests and history; reasons; attachments (e.g., documents or photos).</li>
      <li><strong>Reimbursement Data</strong>: claim details, amounts, and supporting documents (e.g., receipt photos/files).</li>
      <li><strong>Photos/Media & Camera</strong>: camera and photo library access for: (1) face photo during attendance, (2) capturing/uploading HR documents (e.g., ID/receipts), (3) scanning QR codes for attendance or task actions, and (4) updating your profile picture.</li>
      <li><strong>Push Notifications</strong>: device tokens to send request statuses and announcements.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & Diagnostic Data</strong>: device model, OS version, crash logs, and performance data to maintain app stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Purposes of Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features: attendance (face photo verification), leave/permission requests, reimbursement, schedules, and performance display.</li>
      <li>Support QR-based flows configured by your company (e.g., attendance or task confirmation).</li>
      <li>Employee account authentication and management.</li>
      <li>Send push notifications related to statuses and company announcements.</li>
      <li>Technical/diagnostic analytics and service quality improvement.</li>
      <li>Compliance with applicable laws and HR policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>We process data based on: (i) consent (e.g., camera/location access, biometric processing where applicable); (ii) performance of employment/service agreements with your company; (iii) legitimate interests to operate and secure the Application; and/or (iv) legal obligations.</p>


    <h2>5) Device Permissions & Explanations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera</strong> — used to: (1) take your face photo for attendance, (2) capture HR documents (e.g., ID cards, receipts) for upload, (3) scan QR codes for attendance or task actions, and (4) optionally capture images for other HR-related workflows. <em>Example:</em> when you clock in, BiPro uses the camera to take your face photo, verify it against the registered template, store it securely in the cloud, and display it on the HR dashboard for attendance validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Photo Library (Read)</strong> — when you choose images for attachments or to update your profile photo.</li>
      <li><strong>Photo Library (Add/Write)</strong> — only if you choose to save/export photos from the app to your library.</li>
      <li><strong>Location (When In Use)</strong> — to verify that you are within your office geofence when checking in/out.</li>
      <li><strong>Location (Always/Background)</strong> — <em>only if your company enables geofenced auto-logging</em> to detect arrival/leave events. You can disable this in device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — to receive status updates and announcements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can manage permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>


    <h2>6) Use of Face Data (Detailed)</h2>
    <p><strong>What we collect:</strong> a face photo captured at the time of attendance. If your company enables automated matching, we may create and store a biometric template (a mathematical representation of facial features) derived from that photo.</p>
    <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> exclusively to verify that the correct employee performed the attendance action, to attach photo proof in HR records, and to display the attendance photo securely in the HR dashboard. If your company enables automated matching, we may also create and store a biometric template (a mathematical representation of facial features) derived from that photo.</p>
    <p><strong>Sharing:</strong> we do not share face data with third parties. Limited access is provided to authorized HR administrators and our contracted processors (e.g., cloud hosting) under strict data processing agreements.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> data is stored securely on our servers <em>(hosted in [CLOUD PROVIDER & REGION])</em>, with encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access control, and audit logging.</p>
    <p><strong>Retention:</strong> attendance photos and any biometric templates are retained for the minimum period necessary under HR policy and law, typically up to <strong>[RETENTION_PERIOD, e.g., 24 months]</strong>, or <strong>[X days]</strong> after account deactivation—whichever is earlier—after which they are permanently deleted.</p>
    <p><strong>Your choices:</strong> contact your HR administrator or us to request access, correction, or deletion, subject to legal and HR record-keeping requirements.</p>


    <h2>7) Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Treffix</strong> (employer) as the controller/party responsible for HR operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Providers</strong> (processors) such as cloud hosting, database, push delivery (APNs), and crash reporting/technical analytics, bound by data processing agreements and confidentiality obligations.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>8) Cross-Border Transfers</h2>
    <p>As a cloud-based service, data may be processed or transferred to other jurisdictions. We ensure adequate protection consistent with the PDP Law and applicable regulations.</p>


    <h2>9) Retention & Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is retained as long as the account is active or as needed for the purposes outlined, unless required longer by law or your company’s policy.</li>
      <li>Attendance photos/biometric templates follow the retention in Section 6.</li>
      <li>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures (encryption in transit/at rest, role-based access control, reviews and audits) to protect data.</li>
      <li>No method is 100% secure; we continuously improve our security standards.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>10) Data Subject Rights</h2>
    <p>You have rights to access, correct, update, object, restrict, withdraw consent, transfer, or request deletion of your personal data to the extent permitted by law. Requests may be submitted via the contact below or through your company’s HR administrator.</p>


    <h2>11) Children</h2>
    <p>The Application is intended for employee (adult) use and is not designed for individuals under 18 years old.</p>


    <h2>12) Tracking & Advertising</h2>
    <p>BiPro does not engage in cross-app/website tracking for advertising, does not use IDFA, and does not serve targeted ads. If tracking becomes necessary in the future, we will comply with App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and obtain consent in advance.</p>


    <h2>13) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via updates on this page and/or through the Application. The effective date will be updated at the top.</p>
